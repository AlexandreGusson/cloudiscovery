AWS Network Discovery helps you analyze resources in an AWS account.

## Features

### AWS VPC

Example of a diagram:

![diagrams logo](docs/assets/aws-vpc.png)

Following resources are checked in VPC command:

*   EC2 Instance
*   IAM Policy
*   Lambda
*   RDS
*   EFS 
*   ElastiCache
*   S3 Policy
*   Elasticsearch
*   DocumentDB
*   SQS Queue Policy
*   MSK
*   NAT Gateway
*   Internet Gateway (IGW)
*   Classic/Network/Application Load Balancer
*   Route Table
*   Subnet
*   NACL
*   Security Group
*   VPC Peering
*   VPC Endpoint
*   EKS
*   Synthetic Canary
*   EMR 
*   ECS
*   Autoscaling Group
*   Media Connect
*   Media Live
*   Media Store Policy

The subnets are aggregated to simplify the diagram and hide infrastructure redundancies. There can be two types of subnet aggregates:
1.  Private*   ones with a route `0.0.0.0/0` to Internet Gateway
2.  Public*   ones without any route to IGW

### AWS Policy

Example of a diagram:

![diagrams logo](docs/assets/aws-policy.png)

Following resources are checked in Policy command:

*   IAM User
*   IAM Group
*   IAM Policy
*   IAM Roles
*   IAM User to group relationship
*   IAM User to policy relationship
*   IAM Group to policy relationship
*   IAM Role to policy relationship

### AWS IoT

Example of a diagram:

![diagrams logo](docs/assets/aws-iot.png)

Following resources are checked in IoT command:

*   IoT Thing
*   IoT Thing Type
*   IoT Billing Group
*   IoT Policies
*   IoT Jobs
*   IoT Certificates


### Requirements and Installation

This script has been written in python3+ using AWS-CLI and it works in Linux, Windows and OSX.

*   Make sure the latest version of AWS-CLI is installed on your workstation, and other components needed, with Python pip already installed:

```sh
$ pip install -U -r requirements.txt
```

*   Make sure you have properly configured your AWS-CLI with a valid Access Key and Region:

```sh
$ aws configure
```

*   The configured credentials must be associated to a user or role with proper permissions to do all checks. If you want to use a role with narrowed set of permissions just to perform network discovery, use a role from the following CF template shown below. To further increase security, you can add a block to check `aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent` condition in `AssumeRolePolicyDocument`. More on using IAM roles in the [configuration file](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-role.html).

  "Outputs" : {
    "NetworkDiscoveryRoleArn" : {
      "Value" : { "Fn::GetAtt": [ "NetworkDiscoveryRole", "Arn" ]}
    }
  }
}
```

*   (Optional) If you want to be able to switch between multiple AWS credentials and settings, you can configure [named profiles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-profiles.html) and later pass profile name when running the tool.

### Usage

1. Run the aws-network-discovery command with following options (if a region not informed, this script will try to get from ~/.aws/credentials):

1.1 To detect VPC resources:

```sh
$ ./aws-network-discovery.py vpc [--vpc-id vpc-xxxxxxx] --region-name xx-xxxx-xxx [--profile-name profile] [--diagram True/False]
```
1.2 To detect policy resources:

```sh
$ ./aws-network-discovery.py policy [--vpc-id vpc-xxxxxxx] --region-name xx-xxxx-xxx [--profile-name profile] [--diagram True/False]
```
1.3 To detect iot resources:

```sh
$ ./aws-network-discovery.py iot [--thing-name thing-xxxx] --region-name xx-xxxx-xxx [--profile-name profile] [--diagram True/False]
```

2. For help use:

```sh
$ ./aws-network-discovery.py [vpc|policy|iot] -h
```

### Using a Docker container

To build docker container using Dockerfile

```sh
$ docker build -t aws-discovery-network .
```

After build container, you must start container using follow command. The run command will mount a filesystem with your actual aws cli credentials, then you won't need configure aws cli again.

```sh
$ docker run \
-it \
--mount type=bind,source=$HOME/.aws/,target=/root/.aws/,readonly \
aws-discovery-network \
/bin/bash

```

*   If you are using Diagram output and due to fact container is a slim image of Python image, you must run aws-network-discovery.py with "--diagram False", otherwise you'll have an error about "xdg-open". The output file will be saved in "assets/diagrams".

### Translate

This project support English and Portuguese (Brazil) languages. To contribute with a translation, follow this steps:

*   Create a folder inside locales folder with prefix of new idiom with appropiate [locale code](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E23824_01/html/E26033/glset.html). Copy "locales/messages.pot" to locales/newfolder/LC_MESSAGES/.

*   To build ".mo" file running this command from project root folder:

```sh
$ python msgfmt.py -o locales/NEWFOLDER/LC_MESSAGES/messages.mo locales/NEWFOLDER/LC_MESSAGES/messages
```

### TODO

*   Unit tests
*   More types of resources
*   Improved diagram plotting 

### Contributing

If you have improvements or fixes, we would love to have your contributions. Please use [PEP 8](https://pycodestyle.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) code style.

### Development

Make sure you have installed [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/#installation).

Install development requirements:
```sh
$ pip install -U -r requirements-dev.txt
```

Add precommit hooks:
```
$ pre-commit install
```

To run pre-commit hooks, you can issue the following command:
```
