### Requirements and Installation

This script has been written in python3+ using AWS-CLI and it works in Linux, Windows and OSX.

- Make sure the latest version of AWS-CLI is installed on your workstation, and other components needed, with Python pip already installed:

```sh
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- Make sure you have properly configured your AWS-CLI with a valid Access Key and Region:

```sh
$ aws configure
```

- The configured credentials must be associated to a user or role with proper permissions to do all checks. If you want to use a role with narrowed set of permissions just to perform network discovery, use a role from the following CF template shown below. To further increase security, you can add a block to check `aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent` condition in `AssumeRolePolicyDocument`. More on using IAM roles in the [configuration file](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-role.html).

  "Outputs" : {
    "NetworkDiscoveryRoleArn" : {
      "Value" : { "Fn::GetAtt": [ "NetworkDiscoveryRole", "Arn" ]}
    }
  }
}
```

- (Optional) If you want to be able to switch between multiple AWS credentials and settings, you can configure [named profiles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-profiles.html) and later pass profile name when running the tool.

### Usage

1. Run the aws-network-discovery command with following options (if a region not informed, this script will try to get from ~/.aws/credentials):

1.1 To detect VPC resources:

```sh
$ ./aws-network-discovery.py vpc [--vpc-id vpc-xxxxxxx] --region-name xx-xxxx-xxx [--profile-name profile] [--diagram True/False]
```
1.2 To detect policy resources:

```sh
$ ./aws-network-discovery.py policy [--vpc-id vpc-xxxxxxx] --region-name xx-xxxx-xxx [--profile-name profile] [--diagram True/False]
```

2. For help use:

```sh
$ ./aws-network-discovery.py [vpc|policy] -h
```

### Using a Docker container

To build docker container using Dockerfile

```sh
$ docker build -t aws-discovery-network .
```

After build container, you must start container using follow command. The run command will mount a filesystem with your actual aws cli credentials, then you won't need configure aws cli again.

```sh
$ docker run \
-it \
--mount type=bind,source=$HOME/.aws/,target=/root/.aws/,readonly \
aws-discovery-network \
/bin/bash

```

- If you are using Diagram output and due to fact container is a slim image of Python image, you must run aws-network-discovery.py with "--diagram False", otherwise you'll have an error about "xdg-open". The output file will be saved in "assets/diagrams".

### Translate

This project support English and Portuguese (Brazil) languages. To contribute with a translation, follow this steps:

- Create a folder inside locales folder with prefix of new idiom with appropiate locale code (https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E23824_01/html/E26033/glset.html). Copy "locales/messages.pot" to locales/newfolder/LC_MESSAGES/.

- To build ".mo" file running this command from project root folder:

```sh
$ python msgfmt.py -o locales/NEWFOLDER/LC_MESSAGES/messages.mo locales/NEWFOLDER/LC_MESSAGES/messages
```

### TODO

- Improve documentation and code comments
- More services that uses VPC (I'll try add one a week)

### Contributing

If you have improvements or fixes, we would love to have your contributions. Please use [PEP 8](https://pycodestyle.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) code style.
